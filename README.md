# Machine Learning Data Science projects
This repo is for fun projects for the purpose of learning machine learning and data-related knowledge through practice. The codes are written using .rmd

# Softwares/Packages we need
## R
Some projects are implemented in R using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). So [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is needed

## Python
Python projects will be implemented in jupyter notebook brought by [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) using Python 3.6. The following packages will be used:

* Fundamental packages: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* machine learning packages: [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* deep learning packages: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [keras](https://keras.io/)

It is noted that installing XGBoost can somehow be frustrating on Mac OSX. Yet, the following command works like a charm using conda:
```
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost
```
